[Dedge.exchange](https://dedge.exchange) is a new DApp by the [StudyDefi](https://www.studydefi.com) team that allows you to swap _both_ collateral _and_ debt on [compound](https://compound.finance/). It does this by combining existing protocols such as:
- [Compound](https://compound.finance/)
- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/)
- [Aave](https://aave.com/)

# Using Dedge.exchange
Unfortunately due to limitations in the compound protocol (i.e. inability to transfer debt or delegate management for positions), we are not able to migrate existing compound positions. However, it is possible to import/convert a maker vault position into a compound position, as such our recommended way of getting started with [dedge.exchange](https://dedge.exchange) is to:

1. Create a vault with MakerDAO
2. Create a smart-wallet on dedge.exchange
2. Import that vault into dedge.exchange
3. Start swapping your debt/collateral!

# Cool Things I Guess
### During A Bear Market (Shorting ETH/BAT/ZRX...)
1. Swap your debt into a volatile token (e.g. ETH/BAT/ZRX), and swap your collateral into a stablecoin (e.g. DAI, USDC)
2. Profit??

### During A Bull Market (Longing ETH/BAT/ZRX...)
1. Swap your debt into a stabecoin token (e.g. DAI, USDC), and swap your collateral into a volatile token (e.g. ETH/BAT/ZRX)
2. Profit??

# FAQ

Q: Do you have access to my funds?

A: No, the smart wallet has access to your funds. And because you're the creator of the smart wallet, only you have access to your funds. (Unless you gave someone else access)
